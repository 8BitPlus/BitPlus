# Installing and Distributing Bit+ Plugins
### Installing a Plugin
**Only install plugins from people that you trust. A plugin could
contain code that steals your password or infects your computer with malware.**

1. After you download the plugin, you should receive an archive (zip, rar etc)
containing class files.
2. Open `Bit+.jar` with an archive viewer, like WinRAR or 7zip
3. Drag and drop the contents of the downloaded archive into the Bit+ Archive

### Distributing Plugins
<sup>(this tutorial assumes that you are using the Eclipse IDE. if you're not,
go figure this out for yourself or ask for help).</sup>
